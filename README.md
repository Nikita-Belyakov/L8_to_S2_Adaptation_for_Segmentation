# L8_to_S2_Adaptation_for_Segmentation
This project is dedicated to the domain adaptation between landsat-8 and sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, namely, to reach good results for climate structures semantic segmentation, namely clouds and its shadows.

We focus on per channel multispectral domain adaptation between landsat-8 and sentinel-2 imagery with super resolution to 10m.
Ground truth labeled scenes are taken from SPARCS dataset (https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/spatial-procedures-automated-removal-cloud-and-shadow-sparcs-validation-data). We search for capability to adjust Deep-Harmoniation model ensemble (https://github.com/venkatesh-thiru/Deep-Harmonization) for super resolution to climate structures semantic segmentation task.
